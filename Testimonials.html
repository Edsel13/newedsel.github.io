                    <li>In my ICT training I have a lot of great experiences and valuable learnings that makes me a digital literate teacher. With the help of amazing instructors who are experts on the field of computers that taught us the basic into complex about computers specifically in hardware and software.
                        In the first day of training, I have learned about hardware about their parts and functions and able to troubleshoot minor issues regarding about hardware. Next is about learning Microsoft office spreadsheets which is my favorite part of the training. Since it is fun to use Microsoft Excel, you can do many things in excel like making charts. Microsoft Excel is very useful especially that I am a teacher. Next is about learning Microsoft office PowerPoint which is I find it difficult because I am not really good in doing it like designing slides especially in complex details. But I also find it fun because at least I have learned useful tips. So, the last part of the training which is very interesting and will test your patience is when we make codes in HTML, making it is very challenging since it is a trial and error process especially it is my first time doing it. After that, another challenge is converting or making it as my website because there is a big possibilities there will be an error happen nut overall it is fun doing it.
                        That summed up my learning experiences in my ICT training here at NBSC. So grateful that I have this opportunity to be in this training since it [s a big boost to my growth as a responsible and literate digital citizen. Very thankful to our amazing instructors who gave their efforts and sharing their knowledge to us.
